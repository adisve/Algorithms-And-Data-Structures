## Task 2

The efficiency of data structures depends greatly on the use cases and the algorithms they are implemented with. For this task, a queue consisting of a single stack is extremely efficient in case it is an enqueue operation, as we are simply pushing an item to the stack. The dequeue method is linear in nature, as it is being called recursively before reaching the base case.

Comparing this to the queue with two stacks, we can see that the dequeue operation for this implementation would be faster as it does not include recursion and only makes calls to constant time operations such as pop() and isEmpty().

For both of these use cases, we are operating in a FIFO fashion (First In First Out). So it differs from the stack implemented with two queues and the stack with only a single queue. For both of these implementations of the stack data structure, we have at most O(n) operations, for pushing onto the stack.

So in conclusion, from what I can deduce based on the structure of the program and what its purpose is, none of the data structures are more efficient than the others. Each data structure performs at its worst or best based on the algorithms that are implemented for them.
